	Saving what you have edited is done here. If just the command save
(or dump) is given, the the zone will be saved to the input file, overwriting
the old zone. NOTE No backup is made. If there was no input file, the file
will be saved to the default name. ZONE.ZON probably.
	Save can be given an input, in which case it will save in a file 
you specify on the command line. Not the editor can only load files that end
in .zon, so you should specify this in the file name. eg save myzone.zon
