 FILES
~~~~~~~
- *.cfg files are config files for various muds. abered.cfg is the one the 
  editor uses.  To create your own, copy all the flag names into the 
  appropriate place.  Look at one as an example.  Note you can define new flags
  while editing, eg define oflag book and save new config file with global save
  There is a maximum number of flags though.

- *.c The c source files

- types.h has all type declarations in it
- verbs.h contains list of valid commands
- extern.h global variables
- macros.h ....

- HELP directory contains all the help files for reading in the editor

- GNU dir contains some gnu stuff including a copy of go32.exe
  Note the information about binaries compiled with gcc.

To recompile you should need only to type make followed by the the version
to build. (make by itself to get a list)
To run the program, just type abered zonename. You do NOT type the .zone
extension.
