_NO_WFLAGS
	This oprion compiles out the wflag code, thus saves memory for
	the compilers that produce limited memory versions.
	Wflags may still be read in, but they will be ignored and not saved

DOS_MACHINE
	If you are compiling on an IBM machine running any version of DOS
	then you need to define this.

EQBUG
	Define this if your compiler does not have libraries with the
	functions strncasecmp() and strcasecmp()

ANSI_C
	This ensures that ansi C style prototypes are used rather than the
	default OLD C type.  Few other things change as well.

PCC_286
	The pcc compiler is not capable of certain things. In particular this
	will disable the ability to save a comment at the start of the zone.

IBM_MLJ_EDIT
	Compile the simple editor and use it for getting long text decriptions
	from the user.  NOTE that this uses commands found in the IBM GNU
	C Compiler (djgpp) and these may or may not be available or do the
	same things with other compilers.
