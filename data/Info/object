The object of AberMUD

The object?  GAINING POINTS!  How to gain points?  THAT's a good question...

There are three ways to gain points.  One is by gathering treasure, and
dumping it in one of two altars located within the game world.  Of course,
you have to FIND the treasure...

Another way is by killing monsters.  Of course, you'd need a weapon.  But
fighting takes more effort, and presents more risk, so winning can mean
more points.

The best way to advance is by solving puzzles.  That will advance you the
fastest.  And how long do you accumulate points?  Until you reach that all-
sought-after status of omnipotent WIZARD... unreachable though it may seem...
