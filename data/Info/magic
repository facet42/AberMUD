Magic and spells in AberMUD

Many powerful spells lie within the realm of the game.  Several are
specific to certain areas of the land; however, some will work in any
situation.  Some areas of the game are out of reach of your magic. In
addition, you cannot cast spells in the start room, or certain other
areas.

To cast a spell, you must have enough strength, and be of a high enough
level.  These minimums vary from spell to spell.  Generally, most spells
also have a target - you have to specify whom you're casting the spell at.
