In most of the game, your emotions are strictly limited.  Generally, you
can take the following emotion actions by yourself:
  BLUSH    SQUEEK   BURBLE   YAWN     HICCUP   BURP     SMILE    MEDITATE
  SHRUG    COUGH    MOAN     GROAN    PURR     SULK     NOD      SIGH
  SNIFF    FART     BEG      GURGLE   WAVE     WINK     SING     DANCE
  SCREAM   LAUGH    CRY      GIGGLE   SNIGGER  SNICKER  YELP     APOLOGIZE
  CHUCKLE  GRIN     BOW      BOUNCE   SNEER
Here are things you can do to other people (i.e., HUG CAERYNN):
     HUG       NIBBLE    BEARHUG   FONDLE    WHACK     LICK      POKE
     FLIRT     SCRITCH   SNUGGLE   KISS      CUDDLE    STROKE    TICKLE
     STARE     THANK     PAT       SLAP      SQUEEZE
In some rooms, designated as "party rooms", you can do ANYTHING.  To play
in those rooms, just type EMOTE and your action.  The EMOTE command can
also be abbreviated to a colon (:).  So, typing       :jumps around
would cause everyone else to see "Caerynn jumps around" (or whoever you are)
