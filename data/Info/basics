MUD BASICS

What is a MUD?  Put simply, MUD stands for Multi-User Dungeon.  It is a
text adventure game system with a twist:  Multiple users can be online at
the same time, and interact with each other.  Users can work together or
alone to solve puzzles, gather treasure (dumping into an altar for points)
or killing monsters (also for points).  You interact with the game by 
typing multi-word command sentences, like GET RED BOOK, EXAMINE BAR, and
so on.  The game has over 1000 words in its vocabulary, and you can get
an idea of some commands by typing "COMMANDS".

In AberMUD, you have a "persona," a record of your progress through the
game.  The command "SCORE" can tell you how you're doing, as you move
through the game attaining points and levels of experience.  It will also
tell you how strong you are.  Don't let your strength reach 0, or you'll
die, and lose all your points!  Staying smart and alive while gaining 
points is the way to "win" at AberMUD!  Good luck!
