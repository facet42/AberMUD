Talking to people in AberMUD

Talking to people can happen in three basic ways.  You can SAY something,
for example, SAY Hello!, and anyone in the same room as you will hear you.
You can abbreviate SAY to a quote symbol (") if you wish.

You can also TELL someone something, regardless of where they are.  For
example, TELL Caerynn I really need some help! would send the message to
Caerynn regardless of where you each were.

You can also SHOUT a message to everyone in the game.  It's a great way to
get help from other players, but too much shouting might irritate the lords,
causing them to disable shouting (while they recover from their hangovers!)

Of course, one of the other ways of "communicating" with people is through
emotional expression.  Type INFO EMOTIONS for details!
