Moving around in AberMUD

Moving around is easy.  Single word commands allow basic movement, and more
complex actions are also availble.  Generally, exit directions are the four
compass points, and can be abbreviated to single letters "N E S W."  Up and
Down ("U D") and In and Out are also options.  To see what exits are 
available in an area, type EXITS.

Less obvious exits are also often available.  It may be possible to GET IN
something, or CLIMB it, or JUMP off of it (sometimes an easy way to die!)
Experimentation is sometimes the best way to learn!  Typing LOOK will re-
display a room; and, often, exits can be hidden within room descriptions.

If you get stuck, you can always try SHOUTing for help, but it's a hard
land, here...
