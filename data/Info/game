About the AberMUD Game Driver System

AberMUD 5.20.0 is the result of years of work on a time-proven adventure
game system.  Written by Alan Cox, it is the first "full production" Aber
available.  It has been running in the UK for a short time, and is now
online in the United States.  AberMUD has a full programming support system,
and all modifications can be accomplished online.  So, changes will be
occurring in the MUD at random intervals, and it will continue to evolve!
