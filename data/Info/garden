About the Wizard's Garden

The wizards' garden is a place of magic reserved for the wizards.  When a
wizard logs in, he or she starts in the garden.  While in the garden, the
wizards will not hear shouting, telling, or begging.  The garden may be
reached at any time by typing GOTO HOME.  No mortals may enter the garden;
even if transported or summoned there, the strong magic in the place will
immediately eject them.  To talk to mortals, use the Waterfall pool, just
off the garden.  These are two rooms that mortals cannot reach on their
own.
