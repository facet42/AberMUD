This is the 'official' 5.30 AberMUD driver release 0

o	Extensive ANSI cleanups

o	Fixed prototypes to be ANSI in most places

o	Fixed problems with promotion rule variance between K&R and ANSI C

o	Cleaned up the Makefile a little

o	Cleaned up the client massively. Now expects a modern XPG type
	curses library

o	Now passes gcc -pedantic -Wall cleanly

This is the 'official' 5.21 AberMUD driver release 5

o	BSX has its own motd which can contain BSX graphics 
	directives.

o	Returns tidied up, Prototypes updated 

o	Faulty function parameters cleaned up

o	Missing prompt clear on connect added

o	NARG implemented

o	AmiTCP support added, the Amiga version can now sit
	on the internet like the Linux/Unix versions.


Release 5.21 BETA 4 Changes:

o	Long names don't lose caller address information

o	Containers now use the NameCFlag etc fields instead of
	hardcoded field names.

o	Sections of the manual now completed.

o	BSX supports @RMO to remove objects from scenes

o	File descriptor leak printing the motd is fixed.

o	BSX mode input formatting is much better. BSX output
	formatting doesn't generate stray newlines. BSX
	seems ready for real use.

o	Output formatting now uses \r\n everywhere.

o	Linux testing now with 0.99.10 and the improved networking
	software. It's got a couple of small quirks still but its now
	plenty solid enough as a good MUD platform.




Release 5.21 BETA 3 Changes:

o	Snoop shows commands that are typed

o	New actions PROCDAEMON PROCSUBJECT PROCOBJECT SETSUPER GETSUPER

o	BSX fixes to send extra @RFS

o	Doesn't send @TMS when it shouldn't

o	@PUR purge sent to all BSX clients when a BSX object is loaded

o	Ported Client to Linux and 'old' curses.

o	Communications.h is now Comms.h for 14 character file name machines

o	Object editing includes setting description 0



Release 5.21 BETA 2 Changes:

Changes:

o	Clone now handles the inheritance properties. Because building
	a lot of clones with tables would be slow and use a lot of memory
	clones of an item use the original as the superclass, and have 
	blank tables.

o	Deletion tidies up tables which could otherwise get stuck, and 
	invalidate lock counters.


Release 5.21 BETA 1 Changes:

o	Removal of all code written while I worked for Horrorsoft, so its
	no longer arguably not all mine.

o	Removal of AmigaDOS support: It was too much work to keep it in and
	sort it all out so I've dropped it. In theory there should be no
	problem merging the new driver with the old amiga comms. A little
	tweaking might be needed for BSX however.

o	Linux support. This has meant squashing a few bugs in the comms
	layer. Linux tcp/ip isn't yet really up to a full time game driver,
	It's close and I think in one or two more releases (ie about 0.99.7)
	Linux will do the job well.

o	Class inheritance support

o	Quite a few bugs have been splatted including some comms layer ones
	which could (and did occasionally) crash the daemon.

o	Long motd messages work on all machines. The motd is now queued
	like all normal text output, and doesn't rely on an initial
	buffer that might not actually exist.

o	Registration support, so you can write registration only, some
	commands only available to the registered and similar styles of game.

o	Dying does not delete the persona, only blanks it, so you can't kill
	someone and steal the name.

o	BSXmud graphics support is now in prototype form.

o	Client mode bug from 5.20 BETA 2 is fixed.

o	SaveUniverse no longer reports spurious errors

WARNING: 5.21 generates a newer database format than 5.20, to allow for the BSX graphics elements.
