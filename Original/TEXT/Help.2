Certain commands like take and drop support the qualifier 'all', which allows
you to  do something to a group of items.  You also have pronouns you can use
to cut down on typing and to make commands seem more natural.  If you are not
sure what the pronouns are referring, typing 'pronouns' will give you a list.

This is a  multi-player game, and there are therefore commands to talk and to
interact with other players.  The first of these you might use is 'say'. E.g.
'say what on earth is going on here ?'.  You don't need to use  quotes around
the text  in these cases.  You can also tell paticular people  things without
any one else knowing, frequently useful for those evil plots and schemes.  To
tell  a paticular person something  you use the  'tell' command.  For example
'tell eric Shall we kill Dave and split his equipment between us ?'. 

This brings us nicely to death,  which is something that tends to occur a lot
not  only thanks to  other players but also other beings who  wander the game
of their own accord. To start a fight you use the 'kill' command.  It is also
a good  idea to wield a weapon  in case you  are attacked.  Success in combat
depends on your skill with weapons, on the weapon you are using,  and on your
stamina as well as a little luck.
