The Land Of Four Winds is a multi-player interactive adventure game for up to
thirty-two players. You can connect to it using telnet or one of the standard
MUD  client programs,  or alternatively with  the BSX graphics client. As the
game does not yet support pictures, this is a little pointless.

You control your presence in The Land Of The Four Winds by typing commands to
an English language parser.  As with all computer games the commands that the
computer understands are limited. 

Basic commands consist of either a verb or a verb with one or more adjectives
and nouns.  For instance to get this  message you typed 'help'.  Other useful
commands include 'look' to  review where you  are currently,  and score which
will remind you how badly you are currently doing.  Some verbs will behave in
different ways if  they are used with prepositions,  for example you can both
look at and look in something.  

To pick up items, use the command 'take'. To drop items use the command drop.
You can  review what you are carrying by  typing 'inventory' - or if  that is
too much you can abbreviate it to 'i'. You can move around by using typing in
directions.  The 'exits' command  will list any obvious exits  and where they
appear to lead.  There may be other exits,  but you are expected to  use your
head at times.
