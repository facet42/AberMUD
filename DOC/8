.SH Objects
.LP
Any item which can be carried around is probably best set
to be an object. Many things that can't be carried around
are object too. To make something an object type 
.I beobject <item>.
To remove its object properties type
.I unobject <item>.
.LP 
An object has the following properties which can be viewed by
typing 
.I showobject <item>.
.LP
.IP Descriptions: 25
Four descriptions, one for each state. These
are set using
.I setdesc <item> <state> <text>.
As with rooms *text means load from a file. Its
a common trick to use state 3 to hold examine
texts for everything.
.IP Size: 25
The amount of space the item takes out. Set using
setosize. Keep this below about 1000 to avoid 
weights wrapping over the size of a number and
giving odd results. Use the
.I osize <item> <value>
command to set this.
.IP Weight: 25
The weight of the item (without any contents).
The same comments about values apply as with
sizes. Use the 
.I oweight <item> <value>
command to set this.
.IP Flags: 25
Flags controlling the behaviour of an object.
.SP 2
.LP
The flags are:
.IP Flannel: 25
In a description the item is tacked onto the end of
the room description not listed on a line of its own.
.IP NoIt: 25
The item will not automatically become 'it' if seen.
.IP Worn: 25
The item is currently worn.
.IP Destroyed: 25
Obsolete and unused.
.IP CanGet: 25

.IP LightSource: 25
The item is always a light source
.IP Light0: 25
The item is a light source when in state 0
.IP NoSeeCarry: 25
The item cannot be seen when it is being carried. Set
this for small items you would not spot on someone.
.LP
Flags are named with 
.I nameoflag <number> <text>.
They are listed with 
.I listoflags.
You can set and unset flags on an object by doing
.I setoflag <item> <flagname>.
Use -<flagname> to remove a flag.
.SH Containers
Several other classes are commonly associated with Objects, although they can be
used with any type of item. In paticular the container class.
.LP
To make something a container you use the command 
.I BeContainer <item>.
To remove its container properties you use the command
.I UnContainer <item>.
.LP
A container has only two properties
.IP Volume: 25
The total item size you can fit in the item. This is
set with the command
.I setvolume <item> <value>.
.IP Flags: 25
Flags controlling the item.
.LP
The flags are:
.IP soft: 25
The size of the container increases by the size of its
contents. For example a bag.
.IP seethru: 25
The contents of the item can be seen, also light sources
in the item illuminate the parent item.
.IP canputin: 25
You may place items in this item with the standard
database actions.
.IP cangetout: 25
You may take things from this item with the standard
database actions. These are seperate for items like
post boxes.
.IP closes: 25
The item closes, and things can only be removed or
placed in it when it is in state 0.
.LP
The flags are manipulated by using 
.I setcflag <item> <flagname>.
As with the
other classes -<flagname> means clear the flag. Container flags may be listed
with 
.I listcflags
, and named with 
.I namecflag <number> <name>.
.LP
A room can also be a container, in which case you will be unable to enter it if
you won't fit its volume.
