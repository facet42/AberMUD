.SH Players
.LP
A player object is not just a game user, but anything which acts of its
own volition. A player object has properties allowing it to fight, take
damage, carry things and controlling its behaviour a follows.
.LP
.IP UserKey: 16
-1 for all non users, otherwise the user number. This 
cannot be altered.
.IP Strength: 16
This controls how much damage a player can take. When
this is reduced below zero by one of the standard 
database actions death occurs.
.IP Size: 16
The players size. When something is both a player and
an object, the object size is used. For users this
defaults to 120, but can be set.
.IP Weight: 16
The weight of the player. When something is both a 
player and an object, the object weight is used. For
users this defaults to 120 but can be set.
.IP Score: 16
Older versions of the system only saved fields within
the player structure when a user quit. Thus this field
was part of the player structure. It is unused by the
system.
.IP Level: 16 
This is intended to reflect the ability of the player.
The database language provides several functions for
testing and acting on this. The only direct effect it
has is on carrying ability - which is calculated as
10*level+400 units of weight. In addition a player can
carry a maximum of 9 distinct items - ignoring things
like sack contents. These are hard coded due to speed
reasons but may be changed by altering Container.c
.IP Flags: 16
A set of flags governing system handling of the game
object. 
.LP
The flags are:
.LP
.IP male 16
The item is male. It will be addressed as him or he, and
will set the him pronoun.
.IP female 16
The item is female and will set the she pronoun. Setting
both male and female is not supported. Setting neither
makes the item neuter.
.IP brief 16
Indicate to the system that the player wishes to use
brief descriptions and messages whenever possible. Little
in the game system currently uses this.
.IP blind 16
The player is blind and will fail to see some things
happening as a result. Events that can be heard will be
treated as if they were carried out in the dark.
.IP deaf 16
The player is deaf and will not hear anything. Visual
events are unaffected. The game correctly processes 
the combination of blind and deafness (I hope!).
